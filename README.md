# Bayes_AMC
This repo contains implementation for the paper 'Uncertainty-Aware Incremental Automatic Modulation Classification with Bayesian Neural Network'.
If you have any questions, please get in touch with e-mail: luu.chung.13597@gmail.com
# Environment
These models are implemented in Pytorch, and the environment setting is:
* Python 3.10
* Pytorch 1.11
| Dataset | Link |Notes|
| [RML2018.01a](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8267032)| [RML](http://radioml.com) | If RML2018A dataset is too large, you can use shrink_data.py to sample the dataset to get a partial dataset for experimentation.
